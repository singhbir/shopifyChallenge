# Project URL

Project is Hoisted on Netlify [Website](https://nasabir.netlify.app/).

## Tech Stack Used

1. TypeScript
2. React
3. Redux
4. Redux Saga
5. Nasa Mars Api
6. Tailwind CSS

## Default Challenges Achieved

1. Search results should come from NASA’s free APIs.
2. Each image result should list at least a title, date of capture (ideally in earth_date) and a button to “like” that image.
3. Each image can be “liked”, and a user should be able to undo their “like”
4. The HTML that ends up being served client-side should be accessible and semantic (MDN reference)

## Challenges Achieved In this website (Extras)

1. Save likes if the user leaves or reloads the page
2. Animate the “like” action (might we suggest a heart?)
3. Add a loading state while we wait for NASA’s API to return data
4. Add a date-picker to be able to browse photos starting from a specific date
